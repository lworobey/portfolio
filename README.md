# Luke Worobey's Portfolio

This is my portfolio which I built using NextJS as a new framework that I wanted to learn. 

## To visit live

go to [here](lukeworobey.vercel.app) 

I chose to deploy it on vercel's cloud platform for easy Continuous Deployment
## Overview
- On startup there is a welcome to the portfolio
- At the top I have a navbar that says My Portfolio and then has 5 sections
    1. Home: Takes you back to the top
    2. About: This is the about me section of the page
    3. Skills: This is where I show what programs, frameworks and tools I have experience with
    4. Projects: This is where I showcase projects that I've done
    5. Contact: A way to contact me instead of needing to send a direct email.

## Additional resorces used
- Cursor AI, for quick setup to make common knowledge parts coded faster (such as deleting initial NextJS project code, and HTML set up on page.tsx that would take longer to code, but I already know how to do)
- [React](react.dev), used the official docs (not AI) to learn and reinforce core concepts on my own.
